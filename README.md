Shalaila S. Haas is a cognitive neuroscientist who specializes in implementing advanced machine learning techniques to identify links between behavioral patterns and neural signatures. Her work is particularly focused on the identification, prognosis, and prediction of treatment response, primarily in psychosis spectrum disorders. She is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Psychiatry](https://icahn.mssm.edu/about/departments-offices/psychiatry) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City and the director of the [Multimodal Insights into Neuopsychiatric Disorders (MIND) Lab](https://mindlabresearch.com/). 

More specifically, her research aims to unravel the underlying mechanisms that drive the heterogeneity in clinical presentation and progression of psychosis spectrum disorders. She also seeks to better understand mechanisms that contribute to accelerated aging and schizophrenia. This [research](https://mindlabresearch.com/publications/) holds immense potential to advance our comprehension of these complex disorders, offering opportunities for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to alleviate suffering by either preventing the onset of psychosis or by improving the illness course. 

After a clinically-oriented [B.A. in Psychology](https://psychology.berkeley.edu/) from U.C. Berkeley and a methodologically-focused M.Sc. in [Neuro-Cognitive Psychology](https://www.lmu.de/psy/de/studium//m.sc.-neuro-cognitive-psychology/), from the Ludwig-Maximilians University (LMU) in Munich, Germany, she went on to receive a Ph.D. in [Translational Psychiatry](https://www.imprs-tp.mpg.de/108493/alumni-and-friends) from the International Max Planck Research School.
